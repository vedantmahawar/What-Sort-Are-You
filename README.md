Intrigued by recent developents in AI and NLP processing I developed this algorithm to research human sorting behaviors. It compares the likeness of each person's sorting algorithm on a number matrix and informs the user what sorting algorithm (of the four simple sorting algorithms, BOGO, Bubble, Selection, and Insertion), they are most similar to.

As humans evolved, we developed the ability to instinctively categorize and sort items. For instance, when you see an apple, no matter the type of apple, you categorize it as an apple, and your brain instantly references everything you know about apples, recalling the texture, taste, and sweetness. If we didn't, every time we saw an object, we would have to learn everything about it from scratch. This categorization is so inbuilt it emerges in infants at just three months of age.
